<h2>“Please do stats test XYZ”</h2>
<p>When you are collecting data for other modules, or in your Stage 3
projects, you will often find that a member of staff is suggesting that
you analyse your data with a statistical test that you have not heard
of. However, many of these ‘standard’ statistical tests can be
considered to be linear models. If you find it less confusing to
consider them as forms of linear models, then feel free to stick to
that. If you prefer to use the built-in R commands for each test, then
that is fine also. <strong>What matters is the underlying
hypothesis</strong> that you are trying to test. This will determine the
exact structure of your <code>lm</code> or <code>glm</code> function, or
which built-in R command to use instead.</p>
<p>This website simply compares some of the commonly encounted
statistical tests in their <strong>linear model</strong> format and
their <strong>built-in</strong> format. You can find full details of
this philosphy for teaching statistics at <a
href="https://lindeloev.github.io/tests-as-linear/"
class="uri">https://lindeloev.github.io/tests-as-linear/</a></p>
<div id="section-overall-philsophy" class="section level3">
<h3>Overall philsophy</h3>
<p>The key thing to remember is that all these tests can be considered
within the (generalised) linear model framework. Most can be considered
as linear models, although there are a handful that need generalised
linear models (GLMs). The overall philosophy is unchanged, i.e.:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[Response = Explanatory +
\epsilon\]</span></p>
<p>where</p>
<ul>
<li>Response is what you have measured, you assume it changes as a
result of e.g a treatment you have applied</li>
<li>Explanatory is typically your “treatment” in a laboratory experiment
etc.</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\epsilon\)</span> is the unexplained
noise in your data</li>
</ul>
<p>What can be a little confusing is that some of the simpler tests do
not need you to explicitly include an explanatory variable. Some of
these simple tests also may require two response variables. We will
cover these examples as we go through this website.</p>
<p>Although this website shows you both the conventional built-in
command R has for these tests, in common with all statistical software,
the big advantage of the <code>lm()</code> or <code>glm()</code>
approach is that it helps you understand that these tests are all
variations on a theme, and that really what you are trying to do in
every case is fit a <strong>statistical model</strong> to your data. The
data format is consistent for <code>lm()</code> and <code>glm()</code>
whereas it is inconsistent for the built-in tests, and plotting of
graphs is easier when data are prepared for <code>lm()</code> and
<code>glm()</code>. I would therefore <strong>strongly
encourage</strong> you to use <code>lm()</code>, and occasionally
<code>glm()</code> to do these tests, rather than the conventional
built-in commands.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="section-t-distribution" class="section level2">
<h2>t-distribution</h2>
<p>A lot of ‘standard’ statistical tests use the t-distribution, and you
will often here people refer to ‘t-tests’, ‘paired t-tests’, ‘one-sample
t-tests’. These are generally introduced early in statistics courses, as
they are all relatively simple tests, although you have to know when to
apply which one. A disadvantage is that in Stage 3, when supervisors ask
students <strong>“How are you planning to analyse your data?”</strong>
the most common answer is <strong>“Oh, perhaps a t-test”</strong>
because this is the first stats test they learnt and hence the easiest
to remember. But first a quiz about drinks (which yes, does link to
t-tests)…</p>

<p>Even if you managed to find the correct answer, you’re probably
puzzled (unless you already know the strange story). Keep reading…</p>
</div>
<div id="section-the-t-distribution" class="section level2">
<h2>The t-distribution</h2>
<p>This distribution looks very similar to a normal distribution in that
it forms a bell-shaped curve. The differences are only obvious when one
is laid on top of the other, with the t-distribution in red:</p>
<p><img src="Other_tests_files/figure-html/t_vs_normal-1.png" width="624" /></p>
<p>The two curves are very similar, with the t-distribution having
“fatter” tails. It is generally known as <strong>Student’s
t-distribution</strong>. It was developed by W.S.Gossett in 1908 who
worked for Guinness Breweries in Dublin</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="www/Gosset.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Guinness and t-distribution</p>
</div>
<p>Gossett wanted to distinguish between the quality of Guinness stout
based on the different types of malt used in the brewing process, and
developed the t-distribution instead of the normal distribution as it
was slightly more robust with small sample sizes. However, Guinness
Breweries wanted to keep the method secret, and would not let him
publish the technique. Gossett then published it under the pseudonym
“Student” and the name has stuck.</p>
<p>You will often encounter t-statistics, often to check whether an
estimated parameter from a model, such as an intercept or gradient,
differs from zero. If the parameter is big (large negative or positive
value), then the t-statistic will be statistically significant
(p&lt;0.05), whereas if the parameter is roughly zero, the t-statistic
will be non-significant (p&gt;0.05). You may encounter several different
types of t-tests, as well as their <strong>non-parametric</strong>
equivalents.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-parametric-and-non-parametric-tests"
class="section level2">
<h2>Parametric and non-parametric tests</h2>
<p>The most useful and powerful statistical tests are conventional
“parametric” tests. However, many statistical tests exist in
non-parametric versions of their conventional parametric versions, which
can be used when you have highly skewed data with a few extreme
outliers. When data is highly skewed or contains a few extreme outliers,
it often does not follow a normal distribution, which is seen by a shift
away from the bell-shaped curve. We call this type of distribution a
<strong>non-normal distribution</strong>.</p>
<p>Non-normal distributions can take up a number of different forms and
be caused by a number of processes. Non-normal distributions can result
from a number of different scenarios:</p>
<ul>
<li>a natural biological process can give rise to a non-normal
distribution e.g. growth rate of bacteria,</li>
<li>outliers which cause the distribution to become either left or right
skewed,</li>
<li>insufficient data which means a normal distribution cannot be easily
recognised,</li>
<li>your data may be bimodal or multimodal when plotted so in this case
you need to think whether those different modes relate to something
biologically meaningful.</li>
</ul>
<p>Non-parametric tests can be used on data which are non-normally
distributed so do not follow a normal distribution. They are based on
<strong>rankings</strong> rather than the original raw data. So they
would convert the numbers <code>5.2, 1.8, 8.9</code> into
<code>2, 3, 1</code> to represent their <strong>order</strong>. Whilst
they can be useful when your data are very badly skewed, they are far
less powerful in detecting patterns.</p>
<p><strong>Whenever possible, use conventional parametric tests rather
than non-parametric rank-based tests</strong> as rank-based methods are
less useful.</p>
<div id="section-theory-rank-transformation" class="section level3">
<h3>Theory: rank-transformation</h3>
<p>The R command <code>rank</code> simply takes a list of numbers and
“replaces” them with the integers of their rank (1st smallest, 2nd
smallest, 3rd smallest, etc.). So the result of the rank-transformation.
A <em>signed</em> rank is the same, just where we rank according to
absolute size first and then add in the sign second.</p>
<p>To get a better understanding of ranked data, play with the following
code, changing the values of the data used in <code>my_tiny_dat</code>.
There is not a built-in R function for signed-ranks, but we can easily
create one:</p>
<p><code>signed_rank &lt;- function(x) sign(x) * rank(abs(x))</code></p>
<p>This looks a bit cryptic, but it creates your own function, called
<code>signed_rank()</code> to which we give a set of numbers. The
easiest way to see what it does is to create it, and run it with some
example code as shown below:</p>
<div class="tutorial-exercise" data-label="signed_rank_exercise"
data-caption="Code" data-completion="1" data-diagnostics="1"
data-startover="1" data-lines="0">
<pre class="text"><code># Create a simple function for signed_rank

my_tiny_dat        # Original values
rank(my_tiny_dat)  # Rankings are 1 for lowest (-6.3) to 5 for the highest (+8.2)

</div>
<p><strong>Important</strong> Whenever you want to do a signed-rank
test, remember to include the single line from above to create your
<code>signed_rank()</code> function.</p>
<p>Creating ranks is all you need to do to convert most parametric tests
into their “non-parametric” counterparts! This means that <strong>many
“non-parametric tests” are very similar to the conventional parametric
counterparts, but use rank-transformed data</strong>. However, remember
that as they convert your data into “first”, “second” etc. you are
<strong>losing information</strong> so they are less powerful.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="section-one-sample-t-test" class="section level2">
<h2>One-sample t-test</h2>
<p>This is the simplest form of t-test. You are basically trying to
determine whether:</p>
<ul>
<li>the mean of your set of numbers is different from zero (either
positively or negatively), or</li>
<li>whether the mean of your set of numbers is roughly the same as
zero</li>
</ul>
<p>The following diagram summarises the idea for the one-sample t-test.
The question you are addressing is whether the blue horizontal line
significantly differs from zero. The diagram for the left shows the
conventional parametric <strong>one-sample t-test</strong>, that on the
right the non-parametric equivalent using ranks, known as the
<strong>Wilcoxon test</strong>. The one on the left is most useful.</p>
<p><img src="Other_tests_files/figure-html/one_sample_t_test-1.png" width="624" /></p>
<p>In the above plot, notice how the original values are showing for the
t.test plot, whereas the ranked (ordered) values are showing for the
non-parametric Wilcoson plot.</p>
<div id="section-one-sample-t-test-1" class="section level3">
<h3>One-sample t-test</h3>
<p>This is how you can check whether your mean value for your data is
different from zero, using the conventional built-in
<code>t.test()</code> function, or when expressed as a linear model with
<code>lm()</code>. Throughout this course I have been trying to
encourage you to think in terms of:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[Response=Explanatory+\epsilon\]</span>
You are probably a bit puzzled, as if all we are doing is checking
whether our data differs from zero, <strong>Explanatory</strong>. Think
about some of the results of the simple linear models you created in
Practical 2 using the <code>lm()</code> function. It always output a
variable called <code>(Intercept)</code>. R does this automatically. If
you have categorical responses, the Intercept is the overall mean
(average) of all your response data. So in reality R is actually
fitting:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[Response = Intercept + Explanatory +
\epsilon\]</span></p>
<p>but you don’t need to type in the word “Intercept” do get it to do
this. In fact R uses the number <code>1</code> to indicate the intercept
and automatically assumes it is there. So the two lines</p>
<p><code>simple_lm &lt;- lm(y ~ x, data=my_dat)</code></p>
<p>and</p>
<p><code>simple_lm &lt;- lm(y ~ 1 + x, data=my_dat)</code></p>
<p>are exactly the same.</p>
<p><strong>But we don’t have any explanatories?!</strong> If all you
want to do is see if the overall average of your numbers differs from
zero, you do not of course have a set of explanatories. You can tell
simply tell R to only fit the <code>(Intercept)</code> term, which as we
have just seen will be the overall average. So we simply need something
like:</p>
<p><code>simple_ttest &lt;- lm(y ~ 1, data=my_dat)</code></p>
<p>R has a built-in function called <code>t.test()</code> which does the
same thing, but I think the “response ~ explanatory” philosophy is
clearer.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-data-for-one-sample-t-test" class="section level3">
<h3>Data for one-sample t-test</h3>
<p>The simplest thing is for you to enter a single column of values into
Excel (include a column header with a name, no spaces). Then remember to
save it in <strong>.CSV</strong> format into your
<strong><code>Data</code></strong> sub-folder in your
<code>MST2204</code> folder, e.g. <code>mynumbers.csv</code>. Then you
simply need:</p>
<p><code>y &lt;- read.csv("Data/mynumbers.csv")</code></p>
<p>to import your column of values into R in the usual way with
<code>read.csv()</code>.</p>

class="section level3">
<h3>Example of one-sample t-test via both built-in command and linear

<p>Let’s try the two functions, <code>t.test()</code> and
<code>lm()</code> on a dataset <code>y</code> with 50 values (you will
see 49 degrees of freedom as a result).</p>

</div>
<p>Although the formatting of the output from the two tests is slightly
different note that the mean (shown as <code>(Intercept)</code> Estimate
for <code>lm</code>), t-statistics and p-values etc. are almost
identical. As the p-value here is <strong>greater</strong> than 0.05, we
can state that there is no significant difference between the average of
these data <code>-0.0952159</code> and zero.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-wilcoxon-test" class="section level3">
<h3>Wilcoxon test</h3>
<p>This is the non-parametric (rank-based) equivalent. Here we use a
signed-rank method. We can use the <code>wilcoxon.test()</code> or
<code>t.test()</code> functions, but these are yet more functions to
remember. Probably easier to think of it as a standard linear model, use
<code>lm()</code> and add the <code>signed_rank()</code> function. The
following give the same results:</p>
<div class="tutorial-exercise-support" data-label="wilcoxon-setup"

</div>
<p>The p-statistics are approximately the same for both methods. With
very small sample sizes the <code>wilcox.test()</code> will be slightly
more accurate. Again, the p-value is <strong>greater</strong> than 0.05,
indicating that your set of numbers is <strong>not</strong>
significantly different from zero.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="section-paired-t-tests" class="section level2">
<h2>Paired t-tests</h2>
<p>Sometimes you will have a set of samples that are coupled together in
some way. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>You collect water samples upstream and downstream from sewage
outlets from 30 different rivers, and test for the bacterial diversity
in the samples. Now the bacterial biodiversity may well differ between
your individual rivers. What you are really interested in is the
<strong>difference</strong> in diversity upstream and downstream. So you
first calculate the difference between the bacterial diversity, and then
undertake a <code>t.test</code> or <code>lm</code> on the result, to see
if it is significantly different from zero.</li>
<li>You take blood samples from 15 fish before and after they have
received a feed supplement, and want to know if the supplement has any
effect on haemoglobin level. Given that haemoglobin is unlikely to be
the same amongst all 15 fishes even before you do the study, what you
really want to know is whether the <strong>difference</strong> in
haemoglobin before and after the feed is significant from zero.</li>
</ul>
<p>We can illustrate this idea with the following plot:</p>
<p><img src="Other_tests_files/figure-html/paired_t_plot-1.png" width="624" /></p>
<p>The plot on the left shows the original samples, with the pairs
(e.g. upstream or downstream of a sewer outflow) linked by lines. The
plot above right shows the results of subtracting each pair from the
other, that will be analysed to see if the average of these subtractions
is significantly different from zero. So, there is a very slight change
to our original model for the one-sample t-test of:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[Response=Intercept +
\epsilon\]</span></p>
<p>to become:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ResponseA-ResponseB=Intercept +
\epsilon\]</span> For the biodiversity upstream and downstream of sewers
in 30 rivers, this equates to:</p>
<p><span
class="math display">\[BiodiversityUpstream-BiodiversityDownstream=Intercept
+ \epsilon\]</span> whilst for the blood haemoglobin in 15 fishes before
and after the food supplement it is:</p>
<p><span
class="math display">\[HaemoglobinBeforeFeed-HaemoglobinAfterFeed =
Intercept + \epsilon\]</span></p>
<div id="section-data-for-a-paired-t-test" class="section level3">
<h3>Data for a paired t-test</h3>
<p>Again, you’ll find it easiest to enter it into Excel, saving it as a
<code>.CSV</code> format file. However, now you will need
<strong>2</strong> columns of data, labelled e.g. <code>upstream</code>
and <code>downstream</code>, or <code>beforefeed</code> and
<code>afterfeed</code> for the rivers and fish examples respectively. As
usual, save your .csv files in your <strong><code>Data</code></strong>
folder, and use <code>read.csv()</code> to import it into R.</p>
<p>Here is an example of the analysis in R, using either the built-in
<code>t.test()</code> or <code>lm()</code> functions on a dataset of 15
fish with blood haemoglobin, before and after receiving a food
supplement. In this example, the two columns are labelled
<code>before_feed</code> and <code>after_feed</code>, the mean
difference haemoglobin in the fishes before and after being
<code>-0.8412884</code> . Is this value significantly different from
zero?</p>

</div>
<p>Again you can see that the results from the two analyses are very
similar. The syntax of the conventional <code>t.test()</code> function
is a bit clumsy, as you need to specify both the data.frame name
(<code>fish_dat</code>) with the column using the <code>$</code>
specifier. The <code>lm()</code> formulation is much simpler. We set
<code>~ 1</code> as the explanatory, to indicate that we are only
testing whether the overall mean (of the differences) is zero or not.
Note that the <code>(Intercept)</code> value of <code>-0.8412884</code>
is the average of the differences in haemoglobin, before and after
feed.</p>
<p>As the p-value is greater than 0.05, we assume that the fish feed
supplement is not having a significant effect on blood haemoglobin.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-wilcoxon-matched-pairs" class="section level3">
<h3>Wilcoxon matched-pairs</h3>
<p>This is the non-parametric equivalent of the paired t-test. We can
use the same trick as before, of subtracting the values for one pair
from the other in the <code>lm()</code> function, but also using the
<code>signed_rank()</code> function. Remember that you will have to
create the <code>signed_rank()</code> function yourself:</p>

<p>Again, you can see that the p-values are fairly similar. Sticking
with the <code>lm()</code> formulation is much simpler conceptually, and
requires slightly less typing. Remember to create the

<div id="section-independent-t-test" class="section level2">
<h2>Independent t-test</h2>
<p>This is the basic t-test, sometimes referred to as <strong>Student’s
t-test</strong>. Basically you are trying to <strong>compare two
means</strong> to see if they are different:</p>
<p><img src="Other_tests_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png" width="624" /></p>
<p>You might be wondering <strong>How does this differ from a standard
linear model, with a categorical explanatory variable that contains 2
levels?</strong> Well, the short answer is, it doesn’t, it is basically
the same analysis with a different name! The long answer is that in
simple situations like this it is conventional to report the t-statistic
rather than the F-ratio, partly as the t-distribution can correct for
small sample sizes (you may have noticed that the t-distribution and
normal distribution are very similar, but not exactly the same). So the
basic model you are working with is:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[Response = Explanatory +
\epsilon\]</span></p>
<p>where your <em>Explanatory</em> variable is categorical, with only 2
categories (levels).</p>
<div id="section-data-entry-for-students-t-test" class="section level3">
<h3>Data entry for Student’s t-test</h3>
<p>Again, use Microsoft Excel, but save in <code>.CSV</code> format.
However, the way in which you enter your data might be slightly
different:</p>
<ul>
<li>for the built-in <code>t.test()</code> function enter it as two
columns, i.e. “wide” data format. The first for one level of your
explanatory variable, the second for the other one. The explanatory
variable is not explictly coded, but simply indicated by the two
columns.</li>
<li>if using <code>lm()</code> function, two columns, but in “long” data
format. The first column is all of the data, and the second the two
categories of your explanatory (factor) variable which has two
levels.</li>
</ul>
<p>The latter is amenable to boxplots, violinplots etc. You can’t do
this with the former, so this is another advantage of sticking to the
“response ~ explanatory” template.</p>
<p>This example looks at the nerve electro-potential responses in 100
frog muscle samples with and without a cholinesterase inhibitor:</p>

</div>
<p>The p-values and t-statistics are roughly the same for the two
functions, but sticking to the <code>lm()</code> structure gives greater
consistency and clarity than <code>t.test()</code>. The big advantage of
your <code>lm()</code> approach is also that you can easily plot the
data in the usual way. In the <code>lm()</code> output note that:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <code>Estimate</code> on the row marked <code>Intercept</code>
is actually the mean value for the first level of your explanatory,
i.e. <code>control</code> (first level because <code>c</code> for
<code>control</code> comes before <code>i</code> for
<code>inhibitor</code> in the alphabet)</li>
<li>The <code>Estimate</code> for <code>treatmentinhibitor</code> is the
<strong>difference</strong> in the mean value of the two levels of your
explanatory. This difference is statistical significant as p&lt;0.05
atp=0.012</li>
<li>The absolute value of the t-statistic is the same for either the
<code>lm()</code> or <code>t.test()</code> methods</li>
</ul>
<p>When reporting the <code>lm()</code> results you would write
something like <strong>“There was an increase of 0.845 (<span
class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span>/s) in the electro-potential of
muscles receiving cholinesterase (t=2.553, p=0.012, df=98)”</strong>.
Note that the t-statistic as well as the p-value is quoted. As you can
see, the <code>t.test()</code> and <code>lm()</code> approaches give
roughly identical results, but the <code>lm()</code> method is much
easier, and amenable to plotting data etc.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="section-correlation" class="section level2">
<h2>Correlation</h2>
<p>You’re probably familiar with correlation already. High correlation
shows a strong relationship between two variables, and low correlation
occurs when there is a lot of scatter</p>
<p><img src="Other_tests_files/figure-html/correlation_plot-1.png" width="624" /><img src="Other_tests_files/figure-html/correlation_plot-2.png" width="624" /></p>
<p>You can see that the correlation is lower on the second plot, where
the scatter around the line is much bigger. You can calculate the
correlation coefficient with the <code>cor()</code> function. Notice
that <strong>correlation does not imply causality</strong>. Although the
plots above show <em>variable 1</em> on the x-axis and <em>variable
2</em> on the y-axis, they could just as easily be the other way round.
Note also that the gradients of the two lines are roughly the same, but
that does not affect the correlation.</p>
<div class="tutorial-exercise" data-label="correlation_test"
data-caption="Code" data-completion="1" data-diagnostics="1"
data-startover="1" data-lines="0">
<pre class="text"><code># Simple correlation coefficient

</div>
<p>The <code>summary()</code> of the <code>lm()</code> function actually
prints out the R-squared value, which is the % variation explained,
rather than the correlation coefficient. To obtain the correlation
coefficient simply run the <code>sqrt()</code> function on the R-
squared value output from the summary, e.g. <code>sqrt(0.4856)</code> in
this specific example, or the slightly longer
<code>sqrt(summary(c)$r.squared)</code> where <code>c</code> is the
results of your <code>lm()</code> function for a more general
approach.</p>
<p>Play around with the code in the above exercise; you will notice that
the correlation coefficient, r, is unchanged irrespective of whether
var3 or var1 is first in the <code>lm()</code> function call.</p>
<div id="section-rank-correlation" class="section level3">
<h3>Rank correlation</h3>
<p>Again, if your data are very highly skewed you might want to try a
non-parametric method, although sometimes it is better to transform your
data (e.g. with logarithms). Rank correlation is usually referred to as
<strong>Spearman</strong> rank correlation. Again, you can do it with
the built-in R command, or the <code>lm()</code> function. For the
<code>lm()</code> function we simply have to <code>rank()</code> the
values from lowest to highest first. Rank correlation is referred to by
the Greek letter rho, shown as <span class="math inline">\(\rho\)</span>

</div>
<div id="section-ony-way-anova-two-way-anova-ancova"
class="section level2">
<h2>Ony-way ANOVA, two-way ANOVA, ANCOVA</h2>
<p>Actually, you’ve already done these using <code>lm()</code> which is
the easiest way of doing the analyses. Just to recap, in all three cases
the response is a continuous variable, and the explanatories are:</p>
<ul>
<li>One-way ANOVA. <code>lm()</code> One explanatory factor (categorical
variable) with 3 or more levels</li>
<li>Two-way ANOVA. <code>lm()</code> Two explanatory factors
(categorical variables) plus their interaction</li>
<li>ANCOVA <code>lm()</code> with two explanatory variables, one a
factor (categorical), the other a continuous variable (sometimes called
a covariate) plus the interactions.</li>
</ul>
<p>You will find that for Two-way ANOVA with unbalanced data, and for
ANCOVA the most accurate F-values are by using the <code>Anova()</code>
function from the <code>car</code> package which does Type-III Sums of
Squares.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-chi-squared-tests" class="section level2">
<h2>Chi-squared tests</h2>
<p>You are probably familiar with these from Stage 1, where you look at
‘contingency tables’ giving the number of cases across two different
variables, and calculate the <strong>observed</strong> and
<strong>expected</strong> values for each combination, before
calculating the overall Chi-squared statistic.</p>
<p>Chi-squared tests often arise in genetics where you are comparing the
<strong>counts</strong> of different individuals with certain observable
phenotypes or traits. You may recall that we dealt with count data when
we discussed <strong>generalised linear models</strong> and the
<code>glm()</code> function with <strong>Poisson</strong> errors. This
may give you a clue about one method of analysis.</p>
<p>Let’s take a very trivial example, do the calculation by hand (it is
genuinely that simple), then compare the analysis using R’s built-in
command with that via a generalised linear model.</p>
<div id="section-example-data" class="section level3">
<h3>Example data</h3>
<p>Let’s say we want to know whether there is a relationship between
hair colour and eye colour in a random sample of students:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th align="center"></th>
<th align="center">Blue eyes</th>
<th align="center">Brown eyes</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td align="center">Fair hair</td>
<td align="center">38</td>
<td align="center">11</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td align="center">Dark hair</td>
<td align="center">14</td>
<td align="center">51</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Obviously, this is a fairly simple example, and the results are so
clear-cut that you don’t really need any fancy statistics, but it is
useful to work through the calculations nevertheless. What are the
<strong>predicted</strong> frequencies? The simplest model is that hair
and eye colour are <strong>independent</strong>. It is a nice model, as
the maths are straightforward:</p>
<ul>
<li>Expected probability of someone having fair hair? There were 49
people (38 + 11) students with fair hair, out of 114 students. So the
expected probability is 49 / 114</li>
<li>Expected probability of dark hair is (14 +51) / 114 = 65/114</li>
<li>As there are only two categories, not that these two probabilities
add up to one ((49 + 65) / 114) = 1.0</li>
</ul>
<p>When doing these calculations by hand it is often easier to calculate
the marginal (row and column) totals:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th align="center"></th>
<th align="center">Blue eyes</th>
<th align="center">Brown eyes</th>
<th align="center">Row totals</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td align="center">Fair hair</td>
<td align="center">38</td>
<td align="center">11</td>
<td align="center">49</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td align="center">Dark hair</td>
<td align="center">14</td>
<td align="center">51</td>
<td align="center">65</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td align="center">Column totals</td>
<td align="center">52</td>
<td align="center">62</td>
<td align="center">114</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Now what we want to find is, for example, the expected number of
students with blue eyes <strong>and</strong> fair hair out of a class of
114 <strong>if the two traits are independent</strong>. The trick is
that if two probabilities are independent you can multiply them together
to find the overall probability for that feature:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th align="center"></th>
<th align="center">Blue eyes</th>
<th align="center">Brown eyes</th>
<th align="center">Row totals</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td align="center">Fair hair</td>
<td align="center">49/114 * 52/114</td>
<td align="center">49/114 * 62/114</td>
<td align="center">49</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td align="center">Dark hair</td>
<td align="center">65/114 * 52/114</td>
<td align="center">65/114 * 62/114</td>
<td align="center">65</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td align="center">Column totals</td>
<td align="center">52</td>
<td align="center">62</td>
<td align="center">114</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>This gives the following probabilities for each cell in your
table</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th align="center"></th>
<th align="center">Blue eyes</th>
<th align="center">Brown eyes</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td align="center">Fair hair</td>
<td align="center">0.196</td>
<td align="center">0.234</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td align="center">Dark hair</td>
<td align="center">0.260</td>
<td align="center">0.310</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Notice that the four probabilities calculated above add up to 1.0 Now
all you need to do is mulltiply the probabilities with 114, to calculate
the expected numbers of students with each hair and eye colour
combination if they are independent:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th align="center"></th>
<th align="center">Blue eyes</th>
<th align="center">Brown eyes</th>
<th align="center">Row totals</th>

<td align="center">Column totals</td>
<td align="center">52</td>
<td align="center">62</td>
<td align="center">114</td>

<p>Now you can calculate the chi-squared value, <span

<p><span class="math display">\[\chi^2 = \sum{\frac{(O -

<th align="center"><span class="math inline">\(\frac{(O -

</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td align="center">Fair hair and blue eyes</td>
<td align="center">38</td>
<td align="center">22.35</td>
<td align="center">244.92</td>
<td align="center">10.96</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">

<td align="center">11</td>

<td align="center">51</td>
<td align="center">35.35</td>
<td align="center">244.92</td>
<td align="center">6.93</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Add up all four values in the final column to get <span
class="math inline">\(\chi^2 = 35.33\)</span> This can be compared to
the expected <span class="math inline">\(\chi^2\)</span> value if the
hair and eye colour traits really were independent, for the relevant
degrees of freedom. In this case the 5% level is only 3.84, and since
our calculated value is (much) bigger at 35.33 we can reject the
hypothesis of independence between hair and eye colour.</p>

class="section level3">
<h3>Doing the calculations automatically</h3>
<p>That was a bit of a marathon, but hopefully was a useful refresher
for your memory. Let’s do the same calculations in R. There are two ways
of doing the analysis, either the <code>chisq.test()</code> function,
which requires you to input a table of data, or via <code>glm()</code>
where the data are “long” in two columns</p>
<p>First, as a table:</p>
<div class="tutorial-exercise" data-label="chi_sq" data-caption="Code"
data-completion="1" data-diagnostics="1" data-startover="1"
data-lines="0">
<pre class="text"><code>haireye_table &lt;- data.frame( blue = c(38, 14), brown = c(11, 51))
haireye_table

chisq.test(haireye_table)

# The result is highly significant, but note the chi-squared is slightly different
# to the one we calculated by hand. R automatically applies &#39;Yates correction&#39;
# To remove this:
chisq.test(haireye_table, correct = FALSE)</code></pre>
<script type="application/json" data-opts-chunk="1">{"fig.width":6.5,"fig.height":4,"fig.retina":2,"fig.align":"default","fig.keep":"high","fig.show":"asis","out.width":624,"warning":true,"error":false,"message":true,"exercise.df_print":"paged","exercise.checker":"NULL"}</script>
</div>
<p>Now the alternative approach, using a <code>glm()</code>. Here the
data are in ‘long’ format and we use the <span
class="math inline">\(response ~ explanatory\)</span> style, plus
interaction. As you are working with count data, specify
<code>family = "poisson"</code>. Finally, we use the
<strong>Rao</strong> correction in the anova call, as this approximates
to <span class="math inline">\(\chi^2\)</span> better:</p>
<div class="tutorial-exercise" data-label="chi_sq_glm"
data-caption="Code" data-completion="1" data-diagnostics="1"
data-startover="1" data-lines="0">
<pre class="text"><code>haireye_lng &lt;- data.frame( counts = c(38, 14, 11, 51),
                           eye = c(&quot;blue&quot;, &quot;blue&quot;, &quot;brown&quot;, &quot;brown&quot;),
                           hair = c(&quot;fair&quot;, &quot;dark&quot;, &quot;fair&quot;, &quot;dark&quot;))
haireye_lng

# glm equivalent
haireye_glm &lt;- glm(counts ~ eye + hair + eye:hair, family = &quot;poisson&quot;, data=haireye_lng)
anova(haireye_glm, test=&quot;Rao&quot;)</code></pre>
<script type="application/json" data-opts-chunk="1">{"fig.width":6.5,"fig.height":4,"fig.retina":2,"fig.align":"default","fig.keep":"high","fig.show":"asis","out.width":624,"warning":true,"error":false,"message":true,"exercise.df_print":"paged","exercise.checker":"NULL"}</script>
</div>
<p>The line to focus on is the row labelled <code>eye:hair</code> for
the interaction (relationship) between eye colour and hair colour, which
is what we are interested in. The column labelled <code>Rao</code>
contains the <span class="math inline">\(\chi^2\)</span> value which is
the same as our calculated 35.334, and highly significant.</p>
